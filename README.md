# Spot It Garbage
### About:
Spot-It Garbage is an Android app which allows users to pin a location with litter/waste on a Google Maps display and submit details about the site like pictures, its challenge for removal, and a link to a group chat to organize a cleanup. Other users can then view these pins and click on them to see details and join the cleanup via the group chat. The app is based off the principle of crowd-sourcing and social media, allowing users to easily define areas in need of waste management and to recruit help from volunteers.
### How it is built:
Spot-It Garbage is a native Android app written in Java and XML, with a Realtime Database and Cloud Storage using Firebase.
Individual users are able to pin garbage locations and through using Firebase's Realtime Database, these markers are publicly visible.
The app is built using the Google Maps API (displaying the map, finding location, placing markers, etc.)
